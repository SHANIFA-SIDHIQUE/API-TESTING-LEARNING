Lesson 8 - API Testing - Postman - File Upload API - Authentication Types

#Keypoints
1 - File Upload Rest API
2 - Authorization and Authentication
3 - Types of Authorizations in postman
4 - Swagger and cURL


#LearningNotes
1 - Create a new request 
    Choose POST method
    Enter the API endpoint (e.g., https://example.com/upload)
    Go to the Body tab → select form-data
    Add a new key (e.g., file for single files and files for multiple file)
    Change the type from Text → File (if choosing text we have to give the path of the file)
    Click “Choose Files” and upload your test file
    Click Send
    Check the response
    Status Code: 200 (success)
    Response Body: File URL, Upload confirmation, etc. We can add vaildations.

    Common Checks
    File upload succeeds (status 200)
    File format validation (only PDF, JPG, etc.)
    Size limit validation
    File URL is valid and accessible.

2 - Authorization means giving a verified user or system permission to access specific API resources or perform actions (like read, write, delete).
    Authentication = Who are you?
    Authorization = What are you allowed to do?

   ----How to Test Authorization in Postman----
   Go to Authorization tab in your request.
   Choose the required auth type (Basic, Bearer Token, etc.).
   Add credentials, token, or key.
   Send the request.
   Verify:
     Authorized users → 200 OK
     Unauthorized users → 401/403

3 - No Auth - Open APIs — no authentication required
    Basic Auth - Username & Password encoded in Base64 and sent in the request header.
    Digest Auth - Digest Authentication is a more secure form of Basic Auth that uses hashing to protect credentials before sending them to the server.(username and password send in encrypted format).
    Bearer Token Authentication -  Bearer Token Authentication uses a security token (usually issued after login) that’s sent in the request header to authorize API access.
    API Key Authentication - API Key Authentication uses a unique key provided by the server to identify and authorize the client making API requests.
    In API Key Authentication, the key and value are sent as a key–value pair, usually in the Headers or Params of the request.
    OAuth 1.0 - Token-based auth with client ID & secret
    OAuth 2.0 - Token-based, modern and secure

    ---OAuth 2.0 flow---
    Client Registration:
       The application gets a Client ID and Client Secret from the authorization server.
    Authorization & Token Request:
       The user logs in and approves access → the client sends the Client ID and Secret to get an Access Token.
    Access Protected Resources:
       The client uses the Access Token in the request header to access the API securely.


  4 - Swagger - Interactive documentation.
      Provides an interactive API documentation (usually at /swagger or /api-docs)
      Lets you send API requests directly from the browser (like Postman)
      Displays all endpoints, methods, parameters, and response formats
     -------------- Swagger----------------                                   ---------------Postman-----------------
     Used to design, document, and visualize APIs                             Used to test, debug, and automate APIs
     API documentation and exploration                                        API testing and collection management
     Interactive web-based documentation                                      Desktop or web app for sending API requests


     cURL - Client URL
     we can run in cmd prompt also.
     Import - raw text - continue - import button - then we can save to the particular location
     cURL is a command-line tool used to send HTTP requests and interact with APIs directly from the terminal.
     After completion of testing - view documentation - we can publish it too.

     With cURL, you can include everything—HTTP method, headers, body, authentication, and query parameters—in a single command, 
     so you don’t have to set them separately as you often do in GUI tools or manual request setups.
